# How to Sync Forked Repo from Upstream Repo 🤷‍♂️


1. Add the original repository as an upstream repository
```javascript
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/[Original Owner Username]/[Original Repository].git
```
Hence, in this repository it would be
```javascript
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ows-ali/Hacktoberfest.git/
```

### Happy hacktoberfest :smile  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampavangandhi/iampavangandhi/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px">
